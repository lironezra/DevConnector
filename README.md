# DevConnector
Social network for developers

This is a MERN stack application from the "MERN Stack Front To Back" course on Udemy. It is a small social network app that includes authentication, profiles and forum posts.

I expanded the development with facebook authentication and code arcitecture both client and server.

ENJOY :)
